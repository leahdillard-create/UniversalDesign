      <h1>Snowboarding</h1>
    <p>A topic I find super interesting is <strong>snowboarding</strong>. This past season, I went for the first time and have had a lot of fun learning 
        about it as a sport <em>and</em> hobby! It has been <strong>very</strong> hard for me to learn, but it has been really fun to learn about the technique
        to riding along with all of the different types of boards for a variety of terrain styles. My favorite website for learning has been <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-snowboard.html" title="REI-how-to-snowboard" target="_blank">REI Co-Op</a>.
        Snowboarding has a <em>lot</em> to do with being physcially capable on the mountain, 
        but also creating relationships while learning. And the lore of IKON and EPIC passes. But, I can  <em>finally</em> go down green and blue runs and hope to be able to do park riding in the future (and <strong>not</strong> break any bones).
